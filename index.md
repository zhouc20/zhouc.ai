## About Me

I am a first year undergraduate student in [MIT EECS](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/), co-advised by [Tommi Jaakkola](https://people.csail.mit.edu/tommi/) and [Stephen Bates](https://stephenbates19.github.io/). I am affiliated with [CSAIL](https://www.csail.mit.edu/) and [LIDS](https://lids.mit.edu/). My recent research focuses on the intersection of machine learning, generative models and AI4Science. 

Prior to my PhD, I received a bachelor from the [Department of Automation](https://www.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), School of Information at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/index.html). I am also a member of Class of General Artificial Intelligence of Tsinghua University, and I minor in statistics. In my undergraduate research, I am fortunate to work with [Muhan Zhang](https://muhanzhang.github.io/) at Institute for Artificial Intelligence of Peking University. We have great collaborations working on machine learning theories, graph neural networks, AI4Science and LLMs/foundation models. In the summer of 2023, I had the privilege to intern at UCSD advised by [Yusu Wang](http://yusu.belkin-wang.org/) and [Rose Yu](https://roseyu.com/) on machine learning. I also worked with [Gao Huang](https://www.gaohuang.net/) at Tsinghua University on computer vision. 

## Research Interests

My research interest lies broadly in **theoretical and applied machine learning**. I aim to understand the foundations of machine learning, with a special focus on its probabilistic and geometric nature. I'm also interested in application areas including computer vision, natural language processing and computational biology.


%with a focus on learning for (semi-)structured, discrete and combinatorial data including **graph, geometry and topology**. Currently, I aim to understand the foundations of machine learning and graph learning. I'm also experienced in application areas including Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing and Computational Biology.

%Centered at machine learning and graph learning, my long term research goal is to empower science and AI with learning across various subfields including vision, language and structured data. Concretely, I will be dedicated to the following topics: (1) **Multi-modal learning**, or more broadly, foundation models and general purpose AI systems that can perceive and reason like human; (2) **AI4science**, especially for biology, drug discovery and healthcare.

- **Theoretical Machine Learning:** optimization, statistical machine learning, causal inference
- **Generative Models:** diffusion models, LLM and agents, multi-modal foundation models
- **AI for Science:** geometric deep learning, AI4biology, AI4healthcare
