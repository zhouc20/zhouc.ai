## About Me

I am a senior year undergraduate student in [Department of Automation](https://www.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), School of Information at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/index.html). I am also a member of Class of General Artificial Intelligence led by Prof. Songchun Zhu, and I minor in statistics. 

In my undergraduate research, I am fortunate to work with [Muhan Zhang](https://muhanzhang.github.io/) at Institute for Artificial Intelligence of Peking University. We have great collaborations working on machine learning theories, graph neural networks and LLM/foundation models. In the summer of 2023, I had the privilege to intern at UCSD advised by [Yusu Wang](http://yusu.belkin-wang.org/) and [Rose Yu](https://roseyu.com/). I also worked with [Gao Huang](https://www.gaohuang.net/) at Tsinghua University and [Jason D. Lee](https://jasondlee88.github.io/) at Princeton University.

I am actively looking for PhD this year!

## Research Interests

My research interest lies broadly in **theoretical and applied machine learning**, with a focus on learning for (semi-)structured, discrete and combinatorial data including **graph, geometry and topology**. Currently, I aim to understand the foundations of machine learning and graph learning. I'm also experienced in application areas including Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing and Computational Biology.

Centered at machine learning and graph learning, my long term research goal is to empower science and AI with learning across various subfields including vision, language and structured data. Concretely, I will be dedicated to the following topics: (1) **Multi-modal learning**, or more broadly, foundation models and general purpose AI systems that can perceive and reason like human; (2) **AI4science**, especially for molecule representation and generation, drug discovery and healthcare.

- **Theoretical Machine Learning:** information theory, optimization, statistical machine learning, causal inference
- **Empirical Machine Learning:** diffusion models, LLM reasoning
- **AI for Science:** representation and generation of molecules and proteins, drug discovery, healthcare
